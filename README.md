# Reliving ASP Classic with NodeJS

Recently I found a super interesting project. https://eta.js.org/
This project uses a syntax that is very similar to the one in ASP Classic applications. 
Yes those applications written back in the 90s using VB Script.

Oh those times!! heheheh.

So I said, can I use [Eta](https://eta.js.org/) to remember some of those old times ?

I found a nice repository called [Learn-classic-asp](https://eta.js.org/) and I decided to use it to 
bring them back to life powered by nodejs.
